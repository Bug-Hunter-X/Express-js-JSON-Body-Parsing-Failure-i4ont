# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Express.js applications where JSON data sent from a client fails to be parsed correctly, resulting in an empty `req.body` object on the server-side.

## Bug Description

The provided Express.js application uses `express.json()` middleware to parse incoming JSON requests. However, due to a potential misconfiguration or missing middleware, the server fails to parse the JSON data.  This leads to the `req.body` object being empty, preventing proper processing of the client's request. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `express.json()` middleware is properly included and placed before any routes that expect JSON data.
